# Voice Assistant in Python

This is a simple voice assistant built using Python. The assistant can respond to voice commands, perform tasks like opening applications, searching the web, or answering simple queries. The assistant uses speech recognition and text-to-speech synthesis to interact with the user.

## Features

- **Voice Recognition**: Understands commands given by the user in natural language.
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: Converts text responses into speech, allowing the assistant to talk back.
- **Web Search**: Perform Google searches based on the user's request.
- **System Commands**: Open applications (like browsers or text editors) or shutdown the system.
- **Weather Information**: Retrieve weather forecasts using an API.
- **Custom Commands**: Extend the assistant with custom commands for more tasks.

## Requirements

To run this project, you'll need to install the following Python libraries:

- `speech_recognition`: For recognizing voice commands.
- `pyttsx3`: For converting text to speech.
- `pywhatkit`: For performing actions like web searches.
- `wikipedia`: For answering general knowledge queries.
- `requests`: For fetching weather data and other APIs.
- `os`: For system-related tasks.
- `datetime`: For handling time-related queries.

Install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install speechrecognition pyttsx3 pywhatkit wikipedia requests
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/voice-assistant-python.git
cd voice-assistant-python
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Ensure you have a working microphone and speaker on your machine.

## Usage

1. Run the assistant script:

```bash
python voice_assistant.py
```

2. The assistant will listen for your commands. Simply speak into your microphone after the prompt appears.

### Example Commands

- "What time is it?"
- "What's the weather like today?"
- "Search for Python tutorials on Google."
- "Open Chrome."
- "Play some music on YouTube."

## Code Overview

### `voice_assistant.py`

The main script that drives the voice assistant. It integrates all functionalities and listens for commands.

### Functions:

- **`listen()`**: Uses the `speech_recognition` library to listen to the user's voice.
- **`speak(text)`**: Uses `pyttsx3` to convert text into speech.
- **`process_command(command)`**: Processes the recognized command and executes the appropriate function.
- **`get_weather()`**: Fetches the current weather information using a weather API.
- **`search_google(query)`**: Searches Google using `pywhatkit`.
- **`open_application(app_name)`**: Opens a specified application using system commands.

## Example Output

When you run the assistant and say a command like "What's the weather like today?" it might respond:

```
Listening for command...
What can I do for you?
The weather today is sunny with a high of 22°C.
```

## Customization

You can easily extend the assistant's functionality by adding new commands. For instance, if you want your assistant to tell jokes or perform calculations, you can add functions for those tasks.

To add a new command, follow these steps:
1. Define a new function for the task.
2. Add an `elif` block in the `process_command()` function to recognize the new command.

## Troubleshooting

- **Microphone not detected**: Ensure your microphone is properly connected and configured on your machine.
- **Speech recognition not working**: Make sure you have a good internet connection, as some features may require online access.
- **TTS not working**: Check if your speakers are working and the volume is turned up.
